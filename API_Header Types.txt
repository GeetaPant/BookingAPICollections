STATELESS /STATEFULL

Stateless- REST API ( state means session. sessions are independent from each other). Server will not hold any kind of client information, like session id, cookie etc. In RestAPI, POST, GET etc calls are independent of each other . Client supply id with every request and hence it is slower than stateful
Selenium 
Script+ SID (chrome = new chromedriver) ----- Server
Req2 get()+ sid ----- ser 

Stateful- webscokets (playwrite), chat application. Server is maintaining the session id. Client do not supply ID with each request. It is faster . Maintenance is one of the biggest problem with stateful. Additional session storage is required. 

Client (Req 1) --- Server (sessionID)
Req 2 ----- Server(SID)
